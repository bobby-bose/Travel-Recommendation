Unfortunately the Tourism department is unaware of its potential and hence no active promotion as tourist destination. Tourists reach there by chance rather than by design or planning. There can be boating facility across Kanoli canal with Biyyam as an interim halt which should attract tourists in hoards. Such lakes are rare in Northern Kerala and hence still more importance to be accorded. Persoanlly, I had been there first in professional capacity when I 'discovered' the lake after which I go there once in a while. It is easy to cultivate friendship with local boat men who can be ready to help when you reach there on advance communication.

It has a thatched roof of coconut leaves and a simple living space, which indicate his simple life.  Just drink in the quiet surroundings and, if you want to, offer up a small prayer.
